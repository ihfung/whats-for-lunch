### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in your terminal.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log("Wait until you're hungry.");
  } else {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Pick up a snack or grab something you have ready at home.");
    } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log(
        "A well deserve break and should take time to cook a tasty meal."
      );
    } else {
      console.log(
        "This is an intense program after all and you should probably reconsider."
      );
    }
  }
```
